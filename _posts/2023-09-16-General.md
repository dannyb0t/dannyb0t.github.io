## Getting Started

There is a lot to learn for Offensive Security. I will be documenting what resources I have leveraged and found useful during this never-ending learning process :).

Here are two essential tools to kick-off your Workstation :

| Tool Name | Tool Link | Usage |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| VirtualBox | [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads/) | Running Kali in a Virtual Machine |
| Kali | [Kali Download](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) | Kali VirtualBox 64 bit  |

Once your virtualbox is up and running, please follow this [guide](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/) to get started.

After you are in the Kali OS (username: kali, password: kali), open up a terminal and run:
```javascript
sudo su
apt update
```

The commands above indicate you are now root and have updated to the latest packages on your Kali OS! You have already pwned a box :)

## Learning the Fundamentals

It is essential to have strong fundamentals like in any practicion. The fundamentals can carry you quite far, and from there you can build out your own methodology/specializations.
To start off, learning basic networking/security is a must. Please see youtube videos on network+ and security+ to get started (professor messer is a great resource). 
Afterwards, if you have money to spare, HacktheBox Academy is an incredible resource that will take any security enthusiast's fundamentals up to the next level.
