## Getting Started

There is a lot to learn for Offensive Security. I will be documenting what resources I have leveraged and found useful during this never-ending learning process :).

Here's are two essential tools to kick-off Your Workstation :

| Tool Name | Tool Link | Usage |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| VirtualBox | [VirtualBox Download(https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads/) | Running Kali in a Virtual Machine |
| Kali | [Kali Download(https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) | Kali VirtualBox 64 bit  |

Once your virtualbox is up and running, please follow this [guide(https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/) to get started.

After you are in the Kali OS (username: kali, password: kali), open up a terminal and run:
~~~
sudo su
apt update

~~~

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
